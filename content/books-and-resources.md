## Books and Resources

This post should be a constantly updated one enumerating all the books I've read and enjoyed or learned from. I will most likely provide links to such books. I do NOT encourage people to not buy these books and just read them online. In fact, I bought most, if not all of them.

## Books

[Modern Operating Systems 4th Edition --- Andrew Tanenbaum](https://github.com/lighthousand/books/blob/master/Modern%20Operating%20Systems%204th%20Edition--Andrew%20Tanenbaum.pdf)

A must read book for low-level enthusiasts. It explains operating systems from zero with connecting it to history as well so that you see the exact evolution. The book itself is quite modern and still applies today conceptually.

[Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools](https://github.com/lighthousand/books/blob/master/Dragon%20Book%20Compilers%20Principle%20Techniques%20and%20Tools%202nd%20Edtion.pdf)

**To be fully read** An amazing book to get introduced to what LLVM accomplishes. 

[Design Patterns --- Element of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://github.com/TushaarGVS/Design-Patterns-Mentorship/blob/master/Erich%20Gamma%2C%20Richard%20Helm%2C%20Ralph%20Johnson%2C%20John%20M.%20Vlissides-Design%20Patterns_%20Elements%20of%20Reusable%20Object-Oriented%20Software%20%20-Addison-Wesley%20Professional%20(1994).pdf)

Another must read for any OOP user. Describes high-level strategies and patterns that makes you better and planning and implementing complex OOP applications.

[Practical Vim](https://dokumen.pub/practical-vim-edit-text-at-the-speed-of-thought-2nbsped-1680501275-978-1680501278.html)

Great for minimalist Vim users. I prefer to keep plugins at a minimum and some of these tricks help me drop a plugin or two from my workflow. It is definitely a more beginner friendly book.

## Websites

[Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)

A great quick reference for design patterns.

[Linux Inside](https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides)

An amazing guide from 0xAX (as always) on Linux internals. Well structured and goes quite in-depth into the internals. I would recommend it for any OS developer in general. 0xAX's blog on NASM is also spot on and discusses many of the "secrets" in NASM. So unless you want to read the NASM manual again and again (which eventually you WILL do), their guide is a good place to "steal" tricks from.

[Atlassian's Advanced Git tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)

Learning the basics of Git is quite straightforward and the internet offers MANY guides on it. However once you reach a certain level, your knowledge will stagnate. Most of my Git knowledge comes from actually collaborating on real projects, and as such I am missing subtle but important details of Git. Things like amending or rebasing come up often, but have you heard of Gitk or Git hooks? Or Git gc? If not, Atlassian's Advanced Git guide might help you get to know Git more.

## Movies

[Erlang: The Movie](https://archive.org/details/ErlangTheMovie)

A movie about the Erlang language. Even if you don't plan to use the language itself, the Actor-Model paradigm can be implemented/used in any language. Some people hail it as the replacement of OOP.
