<p>Well, this shall be my blogging environment for the future. Currently, I'm working on multiple interesting projects that deserve some write-ups. I do think making such documents might help me deepen my understanding of said subjects.</p>
<h2 id="how-was-this-place-created">How was this place created</h2>
<p>I never had any experience with blogging before. Initially, I wanted to host my own website with some custom dynamic features (such as a built-in editor for writing these blog Markdown files), but I soon realized that putting in so much work for a technology that already exists is not worth it. That's when I got Hugo recommended by <code>pskrgag</code> (who has a great personal website built with it <a href="https://pskrgag.github.io/">here</a>). So I started reading about it and quickly realized how awesome it is. A static site generator not only ensures quick load times but also makes it possible to host my blogs on GitHub paired with GitHub Actions! I love automation so I decided to ditch the idea about making my own blogging platform. This is when I started looking into <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">Hugo</a> and that's how I came across <a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola">Zola</a>. A bit of a history lesson: Jelkyll was the original tool used to do static site generation, however it became increasingly slow. That's how Hugo came along with its blazing fast <code>Go</code> generator. However <code>Hugo</code>'s template files were notoriously hard to understand. That's how <code>Zola</code> came along. Written in <code>Rust</code>, it often provides faster generation times (although the difference between <code>Hugo</code>'s and <code>Zola</code>'s performance is marginal) and offers a more transparent template system. Given the growing popularity of <code>Zola</code> and my Rust fanaticism, I ended up creating this site with <code>Zola</code>. As you can see, it works perfectly well and offers a beautiful (well, at least in my eyes) UI.</p>
